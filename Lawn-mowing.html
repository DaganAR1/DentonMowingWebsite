            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions About Leak Repairs</h3>
            
            <h3>How often should I mow my lawn?</h3>
            <p>For a healthy lawn, mow once a week during the peak growing season. Some fast-growing grasses may need mowing every 5–7 days, while slower-growing or shaded lawns might only need cutting every 10–14 days. Always follow the ‘one-third rule’—never cut off more than one-third of the grass blade height in a single mow. Cutting too much can stress the grass, leading to browning and weaker root growth. Adjust your mowing frequency based on the season, grass type, and weather conditions to maintain a lush, resilient lawn.</p>

            <h3>How short should I mow my grass?</h3>
            <p>For most lawns, aim for a mowing height of 2½ to 3 inches. This height promotes deeper roots, reduces weed growth, and gives a healthier, fuller appearance. Avoid cutting the grass too short, as this weakens the lawn and creates space for weeds to thrive. Taller grass blades provide natural shade for the soil, retain moisture, and improve resilience against drought and heat. Adjust your mower to maintain this height throughout the growing season for the best results</p>

            
            <h3 class="faq-question">How should I maintain my lawn mower?</h3>
            <p><strong>To maintain your lawn mower, follow these essential steps:</strong></p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Stabilize the Fuel:</strong> Add a fuel stabilizer to prevent clogging in the carburetor if the mower sits unused.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Change the Oil:</strong> Regularly replace oil to ensure smooth engine function and longevity.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Charge or Replace the Battery:</strong> Ensure a reliable start by keeping the battery in good condition.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Clean the Deck:</strong> Remove grass clippings from the mower deck to prevent rust and improve airflow.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Replace the Spark Plugs:</strong> New spark plugs improve engine performance and start-up reliability.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Sharpen the Blades:</strong> Sharp blades provide a cleaner cut and reduce grass stress.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Check the Air Filter:</strong> Clean or replace the air filter to keep dust and debris out of the engine.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Replace the Fuel Filter:</strong> A clean fuel filter helps maintain efficient fuel flow and performance.</p>


<h3 class="faq-question">Why does my lawn have brown patches, and how can I fix them?</h3>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>Brown patches in your lawn can be caused by several factors, including grub damage, fungal infections, drought, or dog urine. Here’s how to identify and fix each cause:</strong></p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Grubs:</strong> Grubs eat grass roots, creating sponge-like patches that lift easily when raked. Treat with a grub control product like GrubEx® in early spring to eliminate and prevent grubs.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Fungal Infections:</strong> Brown patches with irregular shapes may indicate fungi. Apply a lawn-safe fungicide and avoid overwatering to reduce risk.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Drought Stress:</strong> Dry, brittle patches often result from inadequate watering. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage root growth.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Pet Damage:</strong> Urine can cause small, discolored spots. Rinse affected areas with water to dilute, or train pets to use specific spots.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>Proper diagnosis and treatment can restore your lawn’s health and prevent future brown patches.</strong></p>


<h3 class="faq-question">What are the best tips for fertilizing my lawn year-round?</h3>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>For year-round lawn health, follow these fertilizing tips:</strong></p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Early Spring:</strong> Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer as grass begins to grow, providing essential nutrients for recovery after winter.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Late Spring:</strong> Apply a fertilizer higher in nitrogen to boost green growth, but avoid over-fertilizing to prevent burning.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Summer:</strong> Use slow-release fertilizers to maintain steady growth and prevent stress during heat. Avoid fertilizing in extreme heat or drought.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Fall:</strong> Fertilize with a mix higher in potassium to strengthen roots before winter, helping the lawn endure colder temperatures.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Winter:</strong> Avoid fertilizing, as most grass types go dormant. Focus instead on clearing debris and preparing for spring.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>Spacing applications at least 6-8 weeks apart, using season-appropriate fertilizers, and avoiding fertilization during droughts will keep your lawn healthy year-round.</strong></p>


<h3 class="faq-question">How much water does my lawn need weekly to stay green?</h3>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>For a green lawn, aim for 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week, including rainfall.</strong></p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Summer:</strong> Water 3–4 times per week in early morning hours to prevent evaporation and meet higher moisture needs in heat. Adjust if there’s significant rainfall.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Spring and Fall:</strong> Typically, watering 1–2 times per week is sufficient, as cooler temperatures reduce water needs.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Winter:</strong> For dormant lawns, water once every 2–3 weeks to maintain soil moisture, or skip watering if your lawn receives rainfall.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>Check soil moisture by pressing a screwdriver into the ground; it should penetrate easily if the lawn is well-watered. Avoid shallow, frequent watering to encourage deeper root growth for a healthier lawn.</strong></p>


<h3 class="faq-question">Should I leave grass clippings on the lawn or bag them?</h3>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>Leaving grass clippings on your lawn is beneficial because it helps return essential nutrients, like nitrogen, to the soil, promoting a healthier, greener lawn. Mulching the clippings allows them to decompose naturally without causing thatch buildup, a common misconception.</strong></p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>Benefits of leaving clippings:</strong></p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Improves Soil Health:</strong> Decomposing clippings add organic matter, enhancing soil structure.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Reduces Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Clippings naturally release nutrients, reducing the need for additional fertilizers.</p>
<p class="faq-answer"><strong>• Saves Time and Effort:</strong> Avoids the extra work of bagging and disposal.</p>

<p class="faq-answer"><strong>Tip:</strong> Only leave clippings if they are short and dry; long, wet clippings may clump and should be bagged to avoid smothering the grass.</p>
